Guess what I received as a 🥳 birthday gift this year from my little sister? 
It's a basket of the most addictive cookies! With a note that read:  "The older you get, the better you get. Unless you're a cookie."😄



I immediately asked her for the recipe and now I'll be generous and share it with the world. I hope these cookies will add a touch of sweetness to more people's everyday life 🥰
The origin of this beloved dessert 
The first chocolate chip cookie was invented in the late 1930s by Ruth Wakefield. The appetizing mix of crunchy cookie and melted chocolate first appeared in her 1938 cookbook as “Tried and True.”
